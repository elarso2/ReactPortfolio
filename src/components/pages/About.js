      <p>
        As a PNW local, I can often be found in the great outdoors, rain or
        shine, be it in hiking boots, on the water, or tearing up the powder on
        my snowboard. And in typical Seattle fashion, I currently work as a
        Manager at No Boat Brewing Company, serving up some tasty microbrews.
        After years of studying Math and Biology in undergrad, with plans to
        enter the medical field, I've decided to study web development instead.
        Throughout my bootcamp I have learned many amazing things, but moreover
        have realized how much I enjoy managing teams and projects, and have
        realized I want to begin a career as a Project Manager, ideally working
        with development teams.
